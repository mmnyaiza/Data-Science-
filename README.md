`Data Science Folder`
This repository contains Python code for three different data science projects:

Movie Recommendations
Stock Predictions
Forex Predictions
Each project has its own folder containing the code and relevant data files.

`Getting Started`
To run the code in this repository, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine, along with several libraries including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`
Movie Recommendations
The movie_recommendations folder contains Python code for building a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The dataset used is the MovieLens dataset, which contains ratings for over 27,000 movies by over 138,000 users.

The code in this folder includes:

movie_recommendations.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the code for building the recommendation system
movies.csv: a CSV file containing information about the movies in the dataset
ratings.csv: a CSV file containing the movie ratings provided by users

Stock Predictions
The stock_predictions folder contains Python code for predicting stock prices using machine learning. The dataset used is historical stock price data for several companies, including Apple, Amazon, and Google.

The code in this folder includes:

stock_predictions.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the code for building the prediction model
AAPL.csv: a CSV file containing the historical stock prices for Apple
AMZN.csv: a CSV file containing the historical stock prices for Amazon
GOOGL.csv: a CSV file containing the historical stock prices for Google

Forex Predictions
The forex_predictions folder contains Python code for predicting forex prices using machine learning. The dataset used is historical forex price data for several currency pairs, including EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY.

The code in this folder includes:

forex_predictions.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the code for building the prediction model
EUR_USD.csv: a CSV file containing the historical forex prices for the EUR/USD currency pair
GBP_USD.csv: a CSV file containing the historical forex prices for the GBP/USD currency pair
USD_JPY.csv: a CSV file containing the historical forex prices for the USD/JPY currency pair
